PHP MVC example plus explanation
================

I am relatively new to web design and have started teaching myself how to build websites based on MVC (model, view, controller) and PHP.  So, here is my very simple attempt and the thought process behind the design.  

If you are completely new to MVC and PHP, I am hoping this is a good way to learn and understand the methodology.  If you are experienced in using MVC and/or PHP and would like to give me a hand in cleaning this up, it would be greatly appreciated.

Getting Started
============
First off, I expect that you are at least somewhat experienced with coding, specifically html, CSS, javascript and PHP.  If you aren't take a little time and learn the basics of each and you should be fine to continue.

Next, lets get this site off the ground, aka be able to use it on your local machine.  Now, this site was built off on the WAMP (windows, apache, MySQL and PHP) server.  So, the easiest way to get started is to go to the WAMP website, download and install the WAMP server.  For now, use default settings for everything.  I haven't tested this on a linux machine or Mac, but I would expect this site will work similarly using LAMP (for linux) and MAMP (for mac).  However, the following configurations are probably quite different.

Now, that WAMP is installed we need to configure it.  


The site should work, but doing the write ups is taking a bit longer than expected, so just a little extra time :)
