<!-- Place all custom css and links to external css files here

Note, there is a CSS hierarchy, meaning order and the target (id vs. class vs. other) matters for CSS.  
Generally, the CSS at the bottom of the page overwrites CSS further up (assuming it is applied to the
same html elements and CSS parameters) and actions that specifically target elements (like id) tend to have a higher priority
In the standard view, this CSS is below the common CSS and bootstrap CSS files, so generally speaking this will have higher priority to those files 
(aka if you want some of the common CSS, but not all you can overwrite their CSS here)

ex: 
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/public/pages/ (page name) / (page name) .css" > 
<style>
    .blah {
         color: green;
     }
